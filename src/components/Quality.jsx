          All raw materials received by our warehouse are thoroughly inspected,
          and our staff checks the color, durability, and colorfastness.

        <p>
          <strong>ðŸ–¤ During Production Inspection</strong><br />
          It does not matter how your products were produced â€“ on a weaving
          machine, printing machine, or on a cutting machine, our engineers
          conduct thorough checks throughout the production process to make sure
          that each label, hangtag and the woven patch is consistent with the
          approved pre-production sample.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>ðŸ–¤ After Production Inspection</strong><br />
          The completed products are then checked once again by our professional
          QC personnel and our QC supervisors also conduct spot checks. Only
          once they are satisfied with the product are they packed, ready for
          delivery.
